•	What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    o	Throughout this course we learned about various data structures along with their benefits and disadvantages. For our final project we had to create an advising assistance software. This program allows a user to load a set of courses and prerequisites for current courses available at ABCU, print the entire course list, and print a specific course along with the prerequisites required for that course. 

•	How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    o	Within this course we did an analysis of different data structures and this was the primary source I used to determine which structure I would use for my project. The structure that I settled on was a BST structure. The main reason I decided on BST was for the quick and easy insertion and deletion along with the search method. 

•	How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    o	There was one big problem that I had when it came to searching for a specific course. At first I was looking everywhere and anywhere for help, such as YouTube and StackOverflow. Ultimately the best thing for me to do was to walk away for a little while and return with a clear head. It was at this point I was able to look at my code and notice that I had a curly bracket in the wrong location. 

•	How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    o	This project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs in many ways. One way is that it helped me see how storing information could be done in different ways but there is a trade-off with speed and memory. Some ways may be easier to implement and maintain, but will have longer run-times and/or use more memory. 

•	How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    o	My work on this project has evolved in many ways, but the most important is how much I pay attention to the details. In previous courses, I found it easy to dive right in and write my programs and didn’t put much thought into pseudocode. With this course I put more thought into my pseudocode and in the end it made coding my project so much easier and cleaner when it comes to organization.
